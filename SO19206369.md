## When to use this as a duplicate target

Questions about why async/await in a WPF or WinForms application still block the user interface.

## Justification

A common misconception is that adding tasks and/or async/await will magically make your form code multithreaded, without
realizing how the underlying technology actually works.

A common problem is reading `.Result` or manual call to `Task.Wait()`, which will block, instead of the continuation style
handling of `await task`.
