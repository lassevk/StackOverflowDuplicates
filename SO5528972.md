## When to use this as a duplicate target

Any question regarding how to properly "encode" or "escape" characters so that one can "safely"
construct a SQL statement containing data from outside.

## Justification

Real answer is don't do it, do proper parameterization instead.

**Todo**: See if I can find a better one, I think I've seen one but can't find it now.
