# [What is a NullReferenceException, and how do I fix it?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660142/what-is-a-nullreferenceexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it/4660186#4660186)

## When to use this as a duplicate target

* Any question regarding `NullReferenceException` that ends up asking "why do I get this?".

## Justification

The reason why this is a good duplicate is that in almost every single case the real answer
is to debug more, and to uncover the reason why there was an expectation that something
wasn't `null` when clearly something has assigned `null` to it. Every such question is different,
so even if the OP says "My question is different", there should be a really good reason given
for why that is before the question is reopened.
